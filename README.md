## Usage

### Alert Component

The `Alert` component is used to display important messages or notifications to the user. It supports multiple variants and sizes, making it flexible for different types of messages, such as success, warning, error, and info.

### Importing the Alert Component

First, you need to import the `Alert` component in your file.

```tsx
import { Alert } from 'uplift-ui';
```

### Basic Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the `Alert` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Alert } from 'uplift-ui';

const AlertDemo = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Alert variant="success" title="Success!">
        Your operation was completed successfully.
      </Alert>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AlertDemo;
```

### Variants

The `Alert` component comes with several variants that help in differentiating between the types of messages. Below are the available variants:

- `default`: Standard alert for neutral messages
- `success`: Used to indicate success messages
- `error`: Displays an error message
- `warning`: Highlights warnings to the user
- `info`: Provides informational messages

### Example:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Alert } from 'uplift-ui';

const AlertDemo = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Alert variant="success" title="Success!">
        Operation was successful.
      </Alert>
      <Alert variant="error" title="Error!">
        Something went wrong.
      </Alert>
      <Alert variant="warning" title="Warning!">
        Be cautious about this action.
      </Alert>
      <Alert variant="info" title="Information!">
        This is an informational alert.
      </Alert>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AlertDemo;
```

### Sizes

The `Alert` component supports different sizes for more flexibility in design. The available size options are:

- `default`: The standard size
- `small`: A smaller version of the alert
- `large`: A larger version for more prominent messages

### Example:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Alert } from 'uplift-ui';

const AlertDemo = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Alert size="small" variant="info" title=" This is a small alert." />
      <Alert size="default" variant="info" title="Default Alert" />
      <Alert size="large" variant="info" title="Large Alert" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default AlertDemo;
```
